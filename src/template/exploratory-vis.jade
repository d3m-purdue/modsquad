          | This portion of the interface is to explore if two features in the 
          | problem dataset are related to each other.  Please select two features
          | to display along the X and Y axes.  All the points in the problem dataset
          | will be plotted in the chart.

          | If the points appear to be randomly arranged, these two features are
          | not strongly correlated.  If the points are arranged in a "fan out"
          | arrangement pointing up and right, the features are correlated because
          | their respective values exhibit a similar trend.

          | This portion of the interface explores three features of the dataset
          | simultaneously.  Please select three features using the buttons below.
          | A 3x3  matrix of plots will then display. Each of these plot 
          | is similar to the Bivariate plot 
          | above, showing whether these two features are correlated or not. 

        p(style='margin-left:40;margin-top:50;margin-right:50')
          | If the points within a single plot appear to be randomly arranged, 
          | these two features are
          | not strongly correlated.  This 3x3 display extends the single plot 
          | above by placing pairs of features together out of the larger feature set.
